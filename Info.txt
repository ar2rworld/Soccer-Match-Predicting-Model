## Inspiration
Practise of machine learning and how to apply it in real-world
## What it does
Predicts match result based on the actual statistic of each player in the team
## How I built it
Scraped information from the webpage(included in the notebook), created datasets, choose Linear Model, fit model, had a lot of troubleshooting, predicted.
## Challenges I ran into
Many errors with shape and type of data for training, lack of data.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
After so many attempts, I got a result, even if it is not 100% correct.
## What I learned
Pytorch library, Pandas and Numpy datatype converting
## What's next for Soccer Match Predicting Model
Add a lot more data for training of the model
